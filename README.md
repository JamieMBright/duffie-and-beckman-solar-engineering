Coded versions of Duffie and Beckman solar energineering book

Coded versions of Duffie and Beckman solar energineering book from chapters 1 and 2. Made a function of Duffie and Beckman process that takes in latitutde longitude elevation time tilt and azimuth and returns the global tilted irradiance upon the different planes. it also returns all the different angles and irradiance subcomponents as calculated by Hottel and Liu and Jordan, the tilted model assigned is the Perez isotropic diffuse model.
